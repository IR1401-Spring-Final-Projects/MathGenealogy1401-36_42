In order to use the BERT classifier, first install gdown using `pip install gdown`, then proceed as below considering the model you want to use:
1. To use "distilbert_base_uncased", first download the trained model using `gdown 132xBqgzsccaZg-E5hmsihoTCvJI7jQUD` and unzip the file, then set the variable MODEL_TO_USE to "distilbert_base_uncased" in bert_classify.py and run it. This model achieves an F-score of 0.09
1. To use "bert_base_uncased", first download the trained model using `gdown 154XTPXWaHnALT3IX8tX32J7-ht_Cz3vI` and unzip the file, then set the variable MODEL_TO_USE to "bert_base_uncased" in bert_classify.py and run it. This model achieves an F-score of 0.13
