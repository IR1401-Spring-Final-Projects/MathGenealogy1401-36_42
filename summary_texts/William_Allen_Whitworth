Allen Whitworth became an editor of the newly founded journal Messenger of Mathematics while still an undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge. He was later elected a fellow of the College and wrote several popular teaching books. He later had a career in the Church and, because of his proposal and encouragement, St John's College set up a Mission for the disadvantaged in London.
