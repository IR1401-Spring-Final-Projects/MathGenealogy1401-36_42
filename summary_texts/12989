Edwin Hewitt made fundamental contributions to functional analysis, measure theory, and topology as well as Diophantine approximation, the structure of semigroups and abstract harmonic analysis. He is well-known for his discovery, in collaboration with Leonard Jimmie Savage, of the Hewitt-Savage zero-one law.
