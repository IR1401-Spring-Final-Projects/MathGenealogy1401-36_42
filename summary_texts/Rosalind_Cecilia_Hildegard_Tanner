Cecily Tanner was the daughter of the mathematicians William Henry Young and Grace Emily Chisholm. She published excellent papers on Riemann-Stieltjes integrals, then she became interested in the history of mathematics. Her efforts led to Thomas Harriot's work being much more widely known and understood.
