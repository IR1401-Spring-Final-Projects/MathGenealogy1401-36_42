Biography
K K Weatherhead's father was  James Weatherhead (born at Whitsome, Berwickshire about 1863) who was a United Free Church Minister. His mother was  Margaret M Weatherhead born Glasgow about 1875. He had two older siblings, Elizabeth (born about 1896) and Leslie (born about 1897).


Weatherhead was born at 18 Kelvinside Terrace, Glasgow. He was educated at Giffnock Academy from 1902 to 1906, Harris Academy, Dundee, from 1906 to 1911, then Dundee High School from 1911 to 1916. He obtained passes in the Leaving Certificate examination at the Higher level in Latin, Mathematics, English, and French in 1915.


After having passed the Preliminary Examination, Weatherhead first matriculated at the University of Edinburgh in October 1916 where he was awarded the John Welsh Mathematical Scholarship. In his first year he took courses at the Ordinary level in Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Latin. His studies, however, had to be put on hold due to World War I in which he served with the Scots Guards. After the war ended he returned to Edinburgh University in 1919 and graduated with an M.A. with First Class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy on 13 July 1922.


In 1922 Weatherhead joined The Scottish Life Assurance Co. Ltd. in Edinburgh and by 1925 he had qualified to become a fellow of The Faculty of Actuaries. In 1929 he became Assistant Actuary of The Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society. Here are a few further highlights of his career.


In December 1935 he was appointed as an external examiner in Actuarial Mathematics for the University of Edinburgh. Then, in February 1938, The Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society promoted him from assistant actuary to joint actuary. In March 1940 The Scottish Temperance and General Assurance Co. Ltd. made the following announcement:-
Owing to the continued expansion of the company, the directors decided to increase the official staff by the appointment of Mr Kenneth K Weatherhead, M.A., F.F.A., as joint secretary with Mr Bowie [in April 1939]. Mr Weatherhead has had a successful professional career in Edinburgh, where he relinquished the position of joint actuary of the Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society to take up service with our Company, and we welcome him as a valuable addition to our staff.
Full details of Weatherhead's career are given in two obituaries at THIS LINK and THIS LINK.


Finally we note that Weatherhead was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining the Society in November 1925.
