Biography
Dov Jarden's parents were Chaim Chalavne Yuzhuk, a shopkeeper in Motele, and Leah Bayer, the daughter of Moshe-Eliezer Cohen and Gittel Bayer.


It is as a Hebrew linguist that Dov Jarden is best known today, but he wrote a number of papers on number theory and, what was almost certainly his greatest contribution to mathematics, he founded the mathematics journal Riveon.


Dov Jarden's son Moshe Jarden has written a fascinating biography of his father specially for this archive, so we wish to give no further details here about Dov Jarden but simply redirect the reader to the appropriate page.
